# Sets
## the empty set
```
	  Ø   = { }
	 |Ø|  =  0
	|{Ø}| =  1
	|{ }| =  0 , Because  Ø   = { }
```

## SetBuilder Notation
```
	{ form | rule  }
	{ m/n  | m,n element in Z, n ≠ 0 }
```

## Cartesian Product AxB
```
	A = {a,b,c}
	B = {0,1}
	then A x B = {(a,0),(a,1),(b,0),(b,1),(c,0),(c,1)}
	|A| = 3
	|B| = 2
	if A and B are finite sets!
		|A x B | = |A| * |B|

	A1 x A2 x ... x An = {(A1, A2, ..., An)| Ai € Ai for all i}
```

## Subset
> B is a subset of A if every element in B is also in A.
### Example 
```
	A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
	B = {1,3,4,5}
	B is a subset of A
```
## power set
```
	is a set of all possible subsets

	If |A| = n
		|P(A)| = 2^n = 2^(|A|)
		Each element can be in a subset or not.
```

### Example's
```
	|P(Ø)| 	= 1 (2^0 = 1)
	
	A = {Ø}
	P({Ø}) = {Ø, {Ø}} = 2
	is A subset in P(A)?
		Yes, {Ø} is in P({Ø})
	is A element in P(A)?
		Yes, Ø is in P({Ø})
```

## set Operations, Venn Diagrams
> each set A is in a universe U 
	
```
A is a subset of U
 ```
